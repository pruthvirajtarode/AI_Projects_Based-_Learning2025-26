# Mario Shooter — Capacitor-ready package

What's included:
- `www/` — your game's HTML/JS/CSS/assets (copied from your uploaded ZIP)
- `package.json` — minimal npm config with Capacitor devDeps
- `capacitor.config.json` — Capacitor config (appId/appName/webDir)
- `setup.sh` — convenience script to run initial commands on a machine with Node & Android Studio installed
- `README.md` — this file with detailed instructions

Important: This ZIP does **not** contain `node_modules` or the Android native project (these must be created on your machine).
I prepared this to be **Capacitor-ready** — after extracting, run the commands below on your computer to create the Android project and build a signed AAB for Play Store.
